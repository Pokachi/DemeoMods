# DemeoMods
Collection of DemeoMods I may or may not make.

Currently, It'll just double all enemy HP. To turn it off, you'll have to uninstall the mod. Alternative, you can use the MelonLoader's "--no-mods" arguement to not load any mods.

Planned Mods:
1. Difficulty Mod
1. Sorting Cards in Hand
1. Stable 3rd person camera for recording and streaming
1. Abstract Scoring System based on time, monsters killed, etc.

# Installation
This mod depends on MelonLoader v0.3.1, available [here](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/actions/runs/851850441).

Once MelonLoader is installed, run it the game once to setup all the directories.

Go to the releases tab and download the DifficultyMod.dll file from the latest release.

Put the DifficultyMod.dll under Mod folder created by MelonLoader in your game directory.


# Uninstallation
Delete DifficultyMod.dll from the Mod folder.
